<h1>What is Ft_print ?</h1>

<p>

* Regardless of the programming language considered, the printf function,(or its equiv- alents) is always highly useful. The main reason is the ease of its formatting, and the support of diverse types in variable numbers. Some variations even propose to be able to write the resulting string of characters either in a file descriptor or in a particular stream. Some also propose to recall this string without printing it. In short, undeniably, printf is a vital function. 

* The versatility of the printf function in C represents a great exercise in programming for us. This project is of moderate difficulty. It will enable you to discover variadic functions in C in a particularly relevant context as well as learn about a great example of a basic “dispatcher” in C via the use of an array of function’s pointers.

* Conversion managed : csp

* Conversion managed with flags h, hh, l, ll : diouxX

* Total floating point management with flags l L

* %% managed

* Flags #0-+and space are managed, also as precision and min-width field

* Bonus : * as argument is managed for field-width

## Install

```sh
make
```

## Usage

```sh
To test your ft_printf, create your libftprintf.a and link it with the argument you want to test.

Example :

gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werrot main_x.c libftprintf.a
